# Hands-on Serverless Computing with Go [Video]

This is the code repository for [Hands-on Serverless Computing with Go [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-serverless-computing-go-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789132830), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Our course will help you make your application serverless with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Save time, effort, and cost by removing the need to manage your own servers while still writing your code in Go. You will first be introduced to AWS, then to writing Lambda functions in Go and using them to access the various AWS services.

We will first get the Go function working on AWS by using the API-Gateway to call it. Using the AWS Command Line interface, we will build our functions on your local computer and save you having to and manage your Go code. Then we will use the AWS SDK to enable your Lambda Go functions to call into other AWS services such as the S3 Bucket. We will then connect the domain to AWS and add HTTPS/TLS security for your users.

Once we have the foundations in place, we will build a secure chat application named Logchat by maintaining sessions, where users must log in before speaking on the chat, introducing the services we need as we go.

With a hands-on approach, you will master security considerations in the AWs Suite, and how to maintain your serverless applications.
